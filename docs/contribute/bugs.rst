How do i submit a bug report?
*****************************

Bugs are tracked as `GitHub issues <https://guides.github.com/features/issues/>`_.
After you've determined this is not a configuration issue, create an issue on github
and provide the following information by filling in `the template <https://github.com/marksie1988/atomic-calendar-revive/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D+>`_.

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
- **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. For example, start by explaining how you installed the plugin. When listing steps, **don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it**. For example, did you use the Lovelace Editor or do the change in YAML directly.
- **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include screenshots, or copy/pasteable configuration snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use `Markdown code blocks <https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines>`_.
- **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
- **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
- **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem.
- **If Chrome's developer tools pane is showing errors**, include these in your report
- **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.

Provide more context by answering these questions:

- **Did the problem start happening recently** (e.g. after updating to a new version of HA / Atomic Calendar Revive) or was this always a problem?
- If the problem started happening recently, **can you reproduce the problem in an older version of Atomic Calendar Revive?** What's the most recent version in which the problem doesn't happen? You can install older versions of Atomic Calendar Revive via HACS or from the releases page on github
- **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.
