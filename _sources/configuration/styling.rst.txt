Styling
#######

In version 9 of the Atomic Calendar Revive I removed all of the color and
style Options, this decission was made due to numerous requests for different
styling to be added and it was becoming unmanageble.

Instead I have now added numerous classes throughout the card, moved to a div
orientated layout which allows for much more customisation with the use of the
amazing `card-mod <https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-card-mod_>`_

The below video shows you how to find the various classes and add styling with
card-mod, if there are classes missing that you need, log a feature request
and I will aim to get that added.
